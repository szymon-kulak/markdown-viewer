# Markdown Viewer

A simple app I created to make learning Markdown easier.

For those unfamiliar, **Markdown** is a markup language used by [Github](https://github.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Discord](https://discord.com/) and many other projects to deliver a consistent text editing experience. It is free and open source, making it ideal for any project.

### Visual Design

I focused on making this app as aesthetically pleasing as possible, designing it with a mobile-first approach, while including a more spacious layout on the desktop:

```scss
@media (min-width: 800px) {
	.App {
		flex-direction: row;
	}
	#editor {
		width: 40dvw;
		height: 90dvh;
		margin: auto;
	}
	#preview {
		width: 55dvw;
		height: 100dvh;
	}
}
```

I also made sure that the app is _actually_ usable on mobile by including a query that disables the preview when using a touchscreen keyboard:

```scss
/* Hide preview when a touchscreen keyboard doesn't leave enough space */
@media (max-height: 400px) and (max-width: 800px) {
	#preview {
		display: none;
	}
	#editor {
		height: 100dvh;
	}
}
```

As with all my apps, I made it easily customisable by including SCSS variables for every colour used throughout the app:

```scss
$body-color: #282c34;
$text-color: #fff8f0;
$preview-color: #15171b;
$block-background: #aaaaaa18;
$code-text: #ff9000;
$heading-color: #6bab90;
$emphasis-color: #ab2346;
$link-color: #6610f2;

#editor {
	font-family: monospace;
	background-color: $body-color;
	color: $text-color;
	text-align: left;
	width: 100dvw;
	height: 40dvh;
	padding: 20px;
	resize: none;
	border: 1px solid $text-color;
	outline: none;
}
```

The colour palette used in the app was created by me to maximise readability and I dare say I'm extremely proud of it, might create a VSCode theme with those colours... ðŸ¤”

### Logic

The app logic was made absolutely trivial thanks to the fine folks who created [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked), a library making it trivial to create markdown previews using JavaScript, so the app is dead simple:

#### State

The app uses React, so synchronising the text between the editor and preview is handled by React's state:

```jsx
const [text, editText] = useState(defaultText);

const textAreaHandler = function (e) {
	editText(e.target.value);
};

<textarea id="editor" value={text} onChange={textAreaHandler} />;
```

Then, said text is parsed by **Marked**:

```jsx
<div
	id="preview"
	dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
		__html: marked(text),
	}}
/>
```

I also customised **Marked** to interpret new lines as HTML `<br/>` tags.

```jsx
marked.setOptions({
	breaks: true,
});
```

And that's about it!

I hope I have been sufficiently clear in my explanations. This app is freely available to use and customise as you see fit.
